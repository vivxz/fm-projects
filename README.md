# mini-projects
This is where I will be building small applications that will allow me to test and learn new techniques, features, and technology that I learn through Frontend Master.   

### Completed applications:  
- [Adopt Me](https://github.com/vivxz/mini-projects/tree/master/Front%20End/React/adopt-me) â€” (in progress)
- [Color Palettes](https://github.com/vivxz/mini-projects/tree/master/Front%20End/React%20Native/react-native)
- [Pet Finder](https://github.com/vivxz/mini-projects/tree/master/Back%20End/GraphQL/client-server)
